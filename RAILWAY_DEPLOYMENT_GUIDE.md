---

## **Prerequisites**

---

## **Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub** (2 minutes)

If you haven't already, push your project to GitHub:

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - ABQ Hotspot Blog"

# Create GitHub repo and push
# (Create repo on GitHub.com first, then)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/abqhotspot-blog.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## **Step 2: Create Railway Account** (1 minute)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Sign up with GitHub (recommended for easy integration)

---

## **Step 3: Deploy Your Project** (3 minutes)

1. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. **Select your repository** (`abqhotspot-blog`)
3. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect it's a Next.js project
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your application
   - Deploy it

---

## **Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database** (1 minute)

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"+ New Service"**
3. Select **"Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway automatically creates and connects the database

---

## **Step 5: Configure Environment Variables** (2 minutes)

In your Railway project dashboard:

1. Click on your **web service**
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add these environment variables:

```env
# Database (Railway auto-provides DATABASE_URL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[automatically-provided-by-railway]

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here

# Cloudinary (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-secret

# Admin credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password

# RSS Configuration
RSS_AUTO_IMPORT=true
RSS_IMPORT_INTERVAL=3600000
```

**Important Notes:**

- Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Railway app URL
- Generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (32+ random characters)

## **Step 6: Set Up Database Schema** (1 minute)

Railway will automatically run your database migrations. The `postbuild` script in your `package.json` handles this:
