# Welcome to My First Post!

This is my first blog post written in MDX. It's pretty cool!

Here's some **bold text** and some *italic text*.

## Features

- Can use Markdown
- Can use React components (we'll add one later!)

Check out this link to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

```javascript
console.log('Hello, MDX!');
```
